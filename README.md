# parking-lot
Any client car, when arrives at the parking building, gets automatically scanned and its weight and
height are passed to the system as the car approaches the gate. The parking has N floors, where each
floor may have a different ceiling height and a different total weight capacity. The system must
assign the approaching car to the best suitable spot and calculate the resulting price per minute.
